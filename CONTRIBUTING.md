# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in qt-ts-tools. Before contributing, please read these guidelines.

### What is a good contribution for this project ?

Below is a an example list of what is a contribution we're looking for, but is not limited to:

* Bug reporting
* Bug fix patch / pull request
* Feature enhancement
* Security vulnerability reporting
* Other improvements

### What contributions is less appropriate for this project ?

This project aims to manipulate Qt translation files, and aims to do it with the simplest usage possible. 
Here's a list of less appropriate contributions:

* Proposal for different file format i.e. `.po` files since it's out of scope for this project.
* New feature patch/pull request for **non-planified** feature (opening a discussion or issue is fine, once validated a patch is welcome).
  * In other words, be sure your idea / feature is approved before starting any work.  

# Ground Rules
### Code of Conduct

In general following [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct) is a pretty good starting point.

### Project philosophy

`qt-ts-tools` aim to a predictable and user-friendly tool. This means any contributions to the project should follow these rules of thumb:
* An input file is never modified implicitly; in other words the user should specify via a specific output path command flag.
* The command line interface should remain consistent across functionalities (e.g. `output-path` should be standard across commands).
* It must target solutions for Qt translation files.
